# Configuring Arcade Deploy

The `arcade deploy` command deploys your worker to the cloud.

## Requirements [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#requirements)

- **Python 3.10** or higher

Verify your Python version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
- **Arcade Account**: Sign up for an [Arcade account](https://api.arcade.dev/signup?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=page&utm_campaign=custom-tools) if you haven’t already.
- **Arcade CLI**: Install the Arcade CLI with `pip install arcade-ai`.

## Deployment Config [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#deployment-config)

The `worker.toml` file is used to configure your worker. Running `arcade deploy` will use the `worker.toml` file in the current directory or you can
specify a different file with the `-d` flag.

Running `arcade new` will automatically create an example `worker.toml` file for the created toolkit.

```nextra-code
# worker.toml

# Arcade Deploy supports configuring multiple workers in a single file.
# Configurations below each [[worker]] block will be deployed as a separate worker.
[[worker]]

# (Required) The worker configuration
[worker.config]

# (Required) The unique identifier for the worker.
id = "my-example-worker"
# (Optional) Whether the worker is enabled.
enabled = true
# (Optional) The timeout for the worker for requests to the worker.
timeout = 30
# (Optional) The number of times to retry a connection to the worker before giving up.
retries = 3
# (Required) The secret for the worker.
# The default "dev" secret or empty string is not allowed.
secret = <your secret>

# (Optional) Localy packages to deploy with the worker.
# You can specify a list of directories that contain a toolkit.
# The directory must contain a pyproject.toml file or a setup.py file.
[worker.local_source]
packages = [ "./my_toolkit1", "./my_toolkit2"]

# (Optional) Pypi packages to install for the worker.
[worker.pypi_source]
packages = [ "arcade-math", "my-pypi-package"]
```

## Secrets [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#secrets)

You can use a secret from the environment to configure the worker with the `${env: MY_SECRET}` syntax.

```nextra-code
[[worker]]

[worker.config]
secret = "${env: MY_ENVIRONMENT_SECRET}"
```

## Using with a local engine [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#using-with-a-local-engine)

To register the worker with your local engine, you can use the host and port flags.

```nextra-code
arcade deploy -h localhost -p 9099 --no-tls
```

## Logs [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/local-deployment/configure/arcade-deploy\#logs)

To see the logs for the worker, you can use the `arcade logs` command.

```nextra-code
arcade logs my-example-worker
```
