# Why evaluate tools?

When deploying language models with tool-calling capabilities in production environments, it’s essential to ensure their effectiveness and reliability. This evaluation process goes beyond traditional testing and focuses on two key aspects:

1. **Tool Utilization**: Assessing how efficiently the language model uses the available tools.
2. **Intent Understanding**: Evaluating the language model’s ability to comprehend user intents and select the appropriate tools to fulfill those intents.

Arcade’s Evaluation Framework provides a comprehensive approach to assess and validate the tool-calling capabilities of language models, ensuring they meet the high standards required for real-world applications.

## Why Evaluate Tool Calling by Task? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#why-evaluate-tool-calling-by-task)

Language models augmented with tool-use capabilities can perform complex tasks by invoking external tools or APIs. However, without proper evaluation, these models might:

- **Misinterpret user intents**, leading to incorrect tool selection.
- **Provide incorrect arguments** to tools, causing failures or undesired outcomes.
- **Fail to execute the necessary sequence of tool calls**, especially in tasks requiring multiple steps.

Evaluating tool calling by task ensures that the language model can handle specific scenarios reliably, providing confidence in its performance in production settings.

## Evaluation Scoring [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#evaluation-scoring)

Scoring in the evaluation framework is based on comparing the model’s actual tool calls with the expected ones for each evaluation case. The total score for a case depends on:

1. **Tool Selection**: Whether the model selected the correct tools for the task.
2. **Tool Call Arguments**: The correctness of the arguments provided to the tools, evaluated by critics.
3. **Evaluation Rubric**: Each aspect of the evaluation is weighted according to the rubric, affecting its impact on the final score.

The evaluation result includes:

- **Score**: A normalized value between 0.0 and 1.0.
- **Result**:
  - _Passed_: Score is above the fail threshold.
  - _Failed_: Score is below the fail threshold.
  - _Warned_: Score is between the warning and fail thresholds.

## Critics: Types and Usage [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#critics-types-and-usage)

Critics are essential for evaluating the correctness of tool call arguments. Different types of critics serve various evaluation needs:

### BinaryCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#binarycritic)

`BinaryCritic` s check for exact matches between expected and actual values after casting.

- **Use Case**: When exact values are required (e.g., specific numeric parameters).
- **Example**: Ensuring the model provides the exact user ID in a function call.

### NumericCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#numericcritic)

`NumericCritic` evaluates numeric values within a specified range, allowing for acceptable deviations.

- **Use Case**: When values can be approximate but should be within a certain threshold.
- **Example**: Accepting approximate results in mathematical computations due to floating-point precision.

### SimilarityCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#similaritycritic)

`SimilarityCritic` measures the similarity between expected and actual string values using metrics like cosine similarity.

- **Use Case**: When the exact wording isn’t critical, but the content should be similar.
- **Example**: Evaluating if the message content in a communication tool is similar to the expected message.

### DatetimeCritic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#datetimecritic)

`DatetimeCritic` evaluates the closeness of datetime values within a specified tolerance.

- **Use Case**: When datetime values should be within a certain range of the expected time.
- **Example**: Verifying if a scheduled event time is close enough to the intended time.

### Choosing the Right Critic [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#choosing-the-right-critic)

- **Exact Matches Needed**: Use **BinaryCritic** for strict equality.
- **Numeric Ranges**: Use **NumericCritic** when a tolerance is acceptable.
- **Textual Similarity**: Use **SimilarityCritic** for comparing messages or descriptions.
- **Datetime Tolerance**: Use **DatetimeCritic** when a tolerance is acceptable for datetime comparisons.

Critics are defined with fields such as `critic_field`, `weight`, and parameters specific to their types (e.g., `similarity_threshold` for `SimilarityCritic`).

## Rubrics and Setting Thresholds [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#rubrics-and-setting-thresholds)

An **EvalRubric** defines the evaluation criteria and thresholds for determining pass/fail outcomes. Key components include:

- **Fail Threshold**: The minimum score required to pass the evaluation.
- **Warn Threshold**: The score threshold for issuing a warning.
- **Weights**: Assigns importance to different aspects of the evaluation (e.g., tool selection, argument correctness).

### Setting Up a Rubric [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#setting-up-a-rubric)

- **Define Fail and Warn Thresholds**: Choose values between 0.0 and 1.0 to represent acceptable performance levels.
- **Assign Weights**: Allocate weights to tool selection and critics to reflect their importance in the overall evaluation.
- **Configure Failure Conditions**: Set flags like `fail_on_tool_selection` to enforce strict criteria.

### Example Rubric Configuration: [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#example-rubric-configuration)

A rubric that requires a score of at least 0.85 to pass and issues a warning if the score is between 0.85 and 0.95:

- Fail Threshold: 0.85
- Warn Threshold: 0.95
- Fail on Tool Selection: True
- Tool Selection Weight: 1.0

```nextra-code
rubric = EvalRubric(
    fail_threshold=0.85,
    warn_threshold=0.95,
    fail_on_tool_selection=True,
    tool_selection_weight=1.0,
)
```

## Building an Evaluation Suite [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#building-an-evaluation-suite)

An **EvalSuite** orchestrates the running of multiple evaluation cases. Here’s how to build one:

1. **Initialize EvalSuite**: Provide a name, system message, tool catalog, and rubric.
2. **Add Evaluation Cases**: Use `add_case` or `extend_case` to include various scenarios.
3. **Specify Expected Tool Calls**: Define the tools and arguments expected for each case.
4. **Assign Critics**: Attach critics relevant to each case to evaluate specific arguments.
5. **Run the Suite**: Execute the suite using the Arcade CLI to collect results.

### Example: Math Tools Evaluation Suite [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#example-math-tools-evaluation-suite)

An evaluation suite for math tools might include cases such as:

- **Adding Two Large Numbers**:
  - **User Message**: “Add 12345 and 987654321”
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `add(a=12345, b=987654321)`
  - **Critics**:
    - `BinaryCritic` for arguments `a` and `b`
- **Calculating Square Roots**:
  - **User Message**: “What is the square root of 3224990521?”
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `sqrt(a=3224990521)`
  - **Critics**:
    - `BinaryCritic` for argument `a`

### Example: Slack Messaging Tools Evaluation Suite [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/evaluate-tools/why-evaluate-tools\#example-slack-messaging-tools-evaluation-suite)

An evaluation suite for Slack messaging tools might include cases such as:

- **Sending a Direct Message**:
  - **User Message**: “Send a direct message to johndoe saying ‘Hello, can we meet at 3 PM?’”
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `send_dm_to_user(user_name='johndoe', message='Hello, can we meet at 3 PM?')`
  - **Critics**:
    - `BinaryCritic` for `user_name`
    - `SimilarityCritic` for `message`
- **Posting a Message to a Channel**:
  - **User Message**: “Post ‘The new feature is now live!’ in the #announcements channel”
  - **Expected Tool Call**: `send_message_to_channel(channel_name='announcements', message='The new feature is now live!')`
  - **Critics**:
    - `BinaryCritic` for `channel_name`
    - `SimilarityCritic` for `message`
