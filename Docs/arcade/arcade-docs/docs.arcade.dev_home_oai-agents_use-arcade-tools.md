## Use Arcade with OpenAI Agents [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#use-arcade-with-openai-agents)

In this guide, let’s explore how to integrate Arcade tools into your OpenAI Agents application. Follow the step-by-step instructions below.

### Prerequisites [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#prerequisites)

- [Obtain an Arcade API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys)

### Set up your environment [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#set-up-your-environment)

Install the required packages, and ensure your environment variables are set with your Arcade API key:

```nextra-code
pip install agents-arcade arcadepy
```

### Configure API keys [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#configure-api-keys)

Provide your Arcade API key. You can store it in environment variables or directly in your code:

> Need an Arcade API key? Visit the [Get an API key](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/api-keys) page to create one.

```nextra-code
import os

os.environ["ARCADE_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_ARCADE_API_KEY"
# Or set it directly when initializing the client
```

### Create and manage Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#create-and-manage-arcade-tools)

Use the `get_arcade_tools` function to retrieve tools from specific toolkits:

```nextra-code
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade
from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools

# Initialize the Arcade client
client = AsyncArcade()

# Get all tools from the "Google" toolkit
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, ["google"])

# You can request multiple toolkits at once
tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, ["google", "github", "linkedin"])
```

### Set up the agent with Arcade tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#set-up-the-agent-with-arcade-tools)

Create an agent and provide it with the Arcade tools:

```nextra-code
from agents import Agent, Runner

# Create an agent with Google tools
google_agent = Agent(
    name="Google agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=tools,
)
```

### Run the agent with user context [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#run-the-agent-with-user-context)

Run the agent, providing a user\_id for tool authorization:

```nextra-code
try:
    result = await Runner.run(
        starting_agent=google_agent,
        input="What are my latest emails?",
        context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
    )
    print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
except AuthorizationError as e:
    print("Please Login to Google:", e)
```

### Handle authentication errors [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#handle-authentication-errors)

If a tool requires authorization, an `AuthorizationError` will be raised with an authorization URL:

```nextra-code
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError

try:
    # Run agent code from earlier examples
    # ...
except AuthorizationError as e:
    print(f"Please visit this URL to authorize: {e}")
    # The URL contained in the error will take the user to the authorization page
```

### Complete example [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#complete-example)

Here’s a complete example putting everything together:

```nextra-code
from agents import Agent, Runner
from arcadepy import AsyncArcade

from agents_arcade import get_arcade_tools
from agents_arcade.errors import AuthorizationError


async def main():
    client = AsyncArcade()
    tools = await get_arcade_tools(client, ["google"])

    google_agent = Agent(
        name="Google agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can assist with Google API calls.",
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        tools=tools,
    )

    try:
        result = await Runner.run(
            starting_agent=google_agent,
            input="What are my latest emails?",
            context={"user_id": "user@example.com"},
        )
        print("Final output:\n\n", result.final_output)
    except AuthorizationError as e:
        print("Please Login to Google:", e)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Tips for selecting tools [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#tips-for-selecting-tools)

- **Relevance**: Pick only the tools you need. Avoid using all tools at once.
- **User identification**: Always provide a unique and consistent `user_id` for each user. Use your internal or database user ID, not something entered by the user.

## Next steps [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/oai-agents/use-arcade-tools\#next-steps)

Now that you have integrated Arcade tools into your OpenAI Agents application, you can:

- Experiment with different toolkits, such as “github” or “linkedin”
- Customize the agent’s instructions for specific tasks
- Try out multi-agent systems using different Arcade tools
- Build your own custom tools with the Arcade Tool SDK

Enjoy exploring Arcade and building powerful AI-enabled Python applications!
