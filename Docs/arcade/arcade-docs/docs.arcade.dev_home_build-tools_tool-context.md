# Understanding ToolContext

## What is ToolContext? [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/tool-context\#what-is-toolcontext)

`ToolContext` is a crucial component in Arcade that manages authorization and user information for tools requiring authentication. Let’s explore how it works and how you can use it in your projects.

`ToolContext` is a class that holds two main pieces of information:

1. Authorization context: This includes a token for making authenticated requests to external APIs as well as structured user information for providers that support retrieving user information.
2. User ID: This identifies the user invoking the tool.

Some authorization providers may also include additional structured user information in the `ToolContext`.

## How ToolContext Works [Permalink for this section](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/tool-context\#how-toolcontext-works)

When you invoke a tool that requires authorization, Arcade’s Tool SDK automatically:

1. Creates a `ToolContext` object
2. Passes this object to your tool

You can then use the `ToolContext` object to make authenticated requests to external APIs.

Now that you understand the basics of `ToolContext`, you’re ready to apply this knowledge in creating your own authorized tools. To learn how to build a custom tool that requires user authorization, check out our guide on [adding user authorization to your tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-auth) or [adding secrets to your tools](https://docs.arcade.dev/home/build-tools/create-a-tool-with-secrets).
